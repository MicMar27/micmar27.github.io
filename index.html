				<h2>Our School</h2>
				<p>We're here representing Bishop Vaughan Catholic School. BVS is a place which nutures students with values of respect, faith and community.</p>
				<p>The school's statement,</p>
				<blockquote>"I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full,"</blockquote>
				<p>encapsulates what Bishop Vaughan stands for - living life to the fullest.</p>
				<p>Being students from Bishop Vaughan who have gotten to work on this project has brought pride and excitement for the kinds of future opportunities for students alike us, interested in pursuing a career in engineering.</p>
				<p>We hope that our contribution to the project not only provides a good impression of our school but shows what kinds of things young people are capable of when they have the resources and support.</p>

			<h2>The National Grid</h2>
			<p>Our school has been assigned to work with the National Grid. National Grid is a company based and operating in the UK and US, providing the public with electricity and gas. It operates with the goal of connecting people to energy that is clean and efficient, as the world changes to be greener.</p>
			<p>An ongoing issue that affects any energy provider is that of the energy crisis, which is the dilemma in which energy is being actively wasted during low demand, and there is not enough to meet requirements during high demand. The solution lies in effectively storing energy during these periods of low demand, so that it can be utilised during peak demand.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="contentBrief">
			<h2>Project Brief</h2>
			<p>The project brief we were given by the national grid had asked us to find a environmentally friendly way to store energy.</p>
			<p>The example they gave us was Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH). The concept was that water gets pumped up a hill using surplus energy. Then once the energy is needed during a high power demand, the water runs down to a lower reservoir due to gravity which also turns turbines. The turbines then generate electricity to satisfy the peak demand.</p>
			<p>However, storing energy is a way that is environmentally conscious, effective, and reliable is no easy feat. This is due to high costs, inefficiency, space requirements, resource availability â€“ the list goes on. This is why the idea to make use of abandoned mines demonstrated through a gravity battery proposed by our team will benefit National Grid, as well as its consumers.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="contentIdea">
			<h2>Our Idea</h2>
			<p>We ran threw a few ideas, until we found our current solution. There is plenty of already existing ways to store energy, but they were all quite expesnive or required something to be built which required an appropriate area.</p>
			<p>Our concept was to use areas that were already built, like in this case a mineshaft, and repurpose it. Most mineshaft around Wales now are capped and abandoned, However with a concept like this we could reuse all that space. 
			<p>The model we had built here is of a gravity battery, a method of storing energy by winding a weight up high and dropping it slowly to wind a motor and generate power. This would require us to build a tall tower or dig out a huge shaft for the weight to have room to travel and generate energy.</p>
			<p>These abandoned mines already have dug out elevator shafts or elevator shafts, and all of that could be repurposed for a similar set up as our model. Our model shows a gravity battery using a repurposed elevator shaft.</p>

		<div class="contentConcepts">
			<h2>Other Concepts</h2>
			<p>However, the gravity battery isn't the main thing we're trying to push forward. We are trying to push forward this idea of using abandoned areas, such as mineshafts, and repurposing them. This would not only save on building costs, but is also more environmentally friendly as it doesnt require us to use more land or resources.</p>
			<p>Mineshafts could easily hold other ways of storing energy too. We have experimented with concepts ranging from sand batteries to compressed air. In theory, you could take a mine, prepare it and strengthen it to hold a high pressure, and then repurpose it into a glorified air tank with a large capacity.</p>
